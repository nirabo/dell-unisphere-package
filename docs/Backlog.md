# Dell Unisphere Mock API Implementation Backlog

This document outlines the implementation plan for the Dell EMC Unisphere REST API mock, focusing on the critical milestone of enabling software upgrade functionality for testing and development purposes.

## Project Overview

The primary goal is to implement a mock API that enables the design, development, and testing of a REST client for the Dell EMC Unisphere API, specifically for upgrading the software of the NAS backend.

## Current Implementation Status

The codebase already has a solid foundation with:

- Authentication & session management
- CSRF token generation and validation
- Basic system information endpoints
- Core API structure with FastAPI

## Implementation Backlog

The backlog is organized into sprints, each with clearly defined tasks and test cases.

### Sprint 1: Core Models and Basic Endpoints

- TC2.4: Verify `prepare` action with valid file
- TC2.5: Verify `prepare` action with invalid file
- TC2.6: Verify authentication and CSRF protection for file upload
- TC2.7: Verify authentication and CSRF protection for prepare action

### Sprint 3: Upgrade Session Management

**Duration**: 1 week

**Objective**: Implement upgrade session creation and management.

#### Tasks:

1. Implement upgrade session creation
   - Create POST `/api/types/upgradeSession/instances` endpoint
   - Implement validation logic
   - Add session initialization

2. Implement upgrade eligibility verification
   - Create POST `/api/types/upgradeSession/action/verifyUpgradeEligibility` endpoint
   - Implement system health check simulation
   - Add validation and error handling

3. Implement upgrade session status tracking
   - Add status transition logic
   - Implement percentage completion simulation
   - Add task tracking

4. Implement upgrade task management
   - Create task creation and update logic
   - Implement estimated time remaining calculation
   - Add task status updates

5. Implement resume action
   - Create POST `/api/instances/upgradeSession/{id}/action/resume` endpoint
   - Implement state transition logic
   - Add validation and error handling

#### Test Cases:

- TC3.1: Verify upgrade session creation with valid candidate
- TC3.2: Verify upgrade session creation with invalid candidate
- TC3.3: Verify upgrade eligibility verification with healthy system
- TC3.4: Verify upgrade eligibility verification with unhealthy system
- TC3.5: Verify upgrade session status updates through different states
- TC3.6: Verify resume action for paused sessions
- TC3.7: Verify resume action for failed sessions
- TC3.8: Verify authentication and CSRF protection for all actions

### Sprint 4: Integration and End-to-End Testing

**Duration**: 1 week

**Objective**: Integrate all components and ensure end-to-end functionality.

#### Tasks:

1. Integrate all components
   - Ensure proper interaction between models and controllers
   - Verify data flow between endpoints
   - Add logging and monitoring

2. Implement end-to-end upgrade workflow
   - Create simulation of complete upgrade process
   - Implement realistic state transitions
   - Add time-based progression

3. Add proper error handling
   - Implement consistent error responses
   - Add validation for all inputs
   - Ensure proper HTTP status codes

4. Ensure response format consistency
   - Verify all responses follow the required format
   - Add response validation
   - Ensure proper content types

5. Document API usage
   - Update API documentation
   - Add usage examples
   - Create test scripts

#### Test Cases:

- TC4.1: Complete end-to-end upgrade workflow test (file upload → prepare → create session → verify → resume)
- TC4.2: Verify all error scenarios (authentication, validation, system health)
- TC4.3: Verify response format consistency across all endpoints
- TC4.4: Verify authentication and session management throughout the workflow
- TC4.5: Verify proper handling of concurrent upgrade sessions
- TC4.6: Verify proper cleanup of resources after upgrade completion
- TC4.7: Verify proper handling of interrupted upgrades

## Out of Scope (Can Be Skipped)

Based on the initial milestone requirements, the following components can be skipped for now:

1. Advanced storage operations (replication, snapshots, etc.)
2. Network infrastructure management
3. Certificate and protocol management
4. LDAP/AD integration
5. Advanced security features
6. Any endpoints not directly related to software upgrade functionality

## Implementation Recommendations

1. **Focus on Minimal Viable Product**: Implement only what's needed for the software upgrade functionality
2. **Leverage Existing Authentication**: Use the existing authentication and session management
3. **Mock Data**: Use mock data for software versions and upgrade sessions
4. **Stateful Simulation**: Implement state transitions for upgrade sessions to simulate real-world behavior
5. **Error Handling**: Ensure proper error handling and validation for all endpoints
6. **Test-Driven Development**: Write tests before implementing features to ensure proper coverage

## Success Criteria

The implementation will be considered successful when:

1. All endpoints required for software upgrade functionality are implemented
2. Authentication and session management work correctly
3. File upload and processing function as expected
4. Upgrade session creation and management work properly
5. All test cases pass
6. The API can be used to develop and test a REST client for Dell EMC Unisphere software upgrades
