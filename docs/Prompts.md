# Project Outline

This project is a FastAPI-based mock implementation of the Dell EMC Unisphere REST API for testing and development purposes.

The initial and critical project milestone is to enable the design, development and testing of a REST client for the Dell EMC Unisphere API, which is to be used to upgrade the software of the NAS backend.

NOTE: This codebase already implements much of what is required, including the authentication and session management, but with limitations.

NOTE: This codebase also implements much of what is NOT requried for the initial milestone, se we would like to ignore those `routes/models/schemas/tests`

What we now need is a project implementation plan, including code structure scanning and writeup, backlog creation and splitup of the backlog into clearly defined sprints. Each sprint is a set of clearly defined tasks, each covered by one or more test cases.

Let's start with the code structure scanning and writeup of what is needed and what can be skipped.

NOTE: All needed documents are in the `docs` directory, where we have the official documentation for each of the used endpoints in the @real_API_interaction_record.md.
